surecell meeting – logo kickoff

The team is looking for a visual identity that feels clinical and precise, but still approachable. They emphasized that the brand should reflect innovation in cell reprogramming without feeling cold or overly sterile.
There was a lot of discussion around the idea of modularity—both in the science and in how the brand might flex across different applications. The word “modular” came up several times, suggesting it’s a core theme.
They’re not interested in flashy or overly stylized visuals. Instead, they want something grounded, technical, and trustworthy. One person described the desired vibe as “Moderna meets Notion”—a mix of scientific credibility and clean, modern design.
In terms of color, they’re leaning toward muted tones—soft blues, slate, and possibly off-whites. They want depth and subtlety, not bright or neon colors.
There was interest in incorporating a subtle reference to cellular structures—maybe a nucleus, membrane, or something abstract that hints at biology without being too literal.
Typography should be clean and sans-serif, but with a bit of warmth—possibly a humanist typeface. They want to avoid anything that feels like a pharma giant or a wellness brand.
The mission centers around making cell therapies more programmable and scalable, and they want the logo to reflect that clarity and ambition.
They’re not especially visual, so they’re relying on us to explore a few conceptual directions. Accessibility and scientific clarity were both mentioned as important brand values.
They don’t have a tagline yet, but they’re open to one if it naturally fits with the logo concept.
