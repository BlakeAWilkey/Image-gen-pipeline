Astro, a space launch startup, wants something that feels space-related, but not overly sci-fi.

They talked a lot about orbits, satellites, and infrastructure in space. 
The word “modular” came up several times—it seems like a core theme.

They’re not into flashy visuals. They want something clean, technical, and modern.
One person said, “like SpaceX but with a bit more warmth.”

Color-wise, they mentioned dark blue, black, and other deep tones. 
They specifically said no neon or overly bright palettes.

There was interest in using a dot or ring around a letter—maybe the “o” in Astro.

They prefer clean, sans-serif fonts. Lowercase might be a good direction to explore.

They don’t want it to look like a toy company or anything retro-futuristic.

Their mission is to make space infrastructure easier to deploy and scale. 
They also mentioned “accessibility” and “future-proof” a few times.

They’re not super visual, so they’re relying on us to explore a few directions. 
No tagline yet, but they’re open to one if it fits naturally with the logo.
